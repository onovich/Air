# Air
![](https://github.com/onovich/Air/blob/main/Assets/Resources_Sample/cover_air.jpg)

A game based on the Boids algorithm. Based on the GameJam game [Flow](https://github.com/onovich/Flow). <br/>
**基于 Boids 算法的游戏。以 GameJam 游戏 [Flow](https://github.com/onovich/Flow) 为基础。**

The Boids part has been optimized using a Compute Shader, and the standalone implementation has been extracted from the project, see [BoidsSample](https://github.com/onovich/BoidsSample/tree/main). <br/>
**Boids 的部分使用了 Compute Shader 优化，单独的实现已经从项目中摘出，见 [BoidsSample](https://github.com/onovich/BoidsSample/tree/main)。**

There is no pressure running 1000 units in full screen.<br/>
**目前全屏跑1000个单位无压力。**

Currently under slow development, only the Boids part has been implemented. The gameplay has not been ported yet and needs to be redesigned.<br/>
**缓慢研发中，目前仅实现 Boids 算法的部分，尚未移植玩法，玩法部分需要重新设计。**
